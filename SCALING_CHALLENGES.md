# E-Commerce Scaling Challenges & Solutions

This document outlines common scaling challenges faced by e-commerce applications and proposed solutions to address them proactively.

## 1. Inventory Race Conditions

**Problem:** Multiple users attempting to purchase the same limited inventory items simultaneously can lead to overselling.

**Solutions:**
- **Pessimistic Locking:** Lock inventory records during checkout process
- **Inventory Reservation System:** Create time-limited holds during checkout flow
- **Event-Driven Processing:** Queue inventory updates to process sequentially
- **Compensating Transactions:** Implement order-reversal workflows if inventory checks fail post-purchase

**Implementation Priority:** HIGH - Critical for marketplace integrity

## 2. Flash Sale / Traffic Spikes

**Problem:** Promotional events can cause extreme traffic spikes that overwhelm systems.

**Solutions:**
- **Application Caching:** Cache product details, pricing, and images
- **Queue-Based Architecture:** Place orders in a processing queue during peak loads
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Auto-scaling infrastructure for web and API tiers
- **Static Content Offloading:** Move static assets to CDN
- **Throttling & Rate Limiting:** Apply limits by user/IP during extreme events

**Implementation Priority:** MEDIUM - Important before major promotions

## 3. Payment Processing Failures

**Problem:** Transient payment gateway issues can lead to lost orders and revenue.

**Solutions:**
- **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement exponential backoff for failed payment attempts
- **Payment Intent Pattern:** Use Stripe Payment Intents or similar two-phase commits
- **Payment Queue:** Process payments asynchronously with status tracking
- **Multiple Payment Providers:** Support fallback payment processors
- **Partial Order Fulfillment:** Allow splitting orders if some items can be processed

**Implementation Priority:** HIGH - Critical for revenue protection

## 4. Database Scaling Bottlenecks

**Problem:** As order volume grows, database performance becomes a bottleneck.

**Solutions:**
- **Read Replicas:** Offload read queries to database replicas
- **Data Partitioning:** Shard data by customer, geography, or time periods
- **Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS):** Separate read and write models
- **Time-Based Archiving:** Move historical orders to data warehouse
- **NoSQL for Specific Workloads:** Use specialized databases for appropriate data types

**Implementation Priority:** MEDIUM - Plan before significant growth

## 5. Session Management & Cart Persistence

**Problem:** Managing user sessions and carts across multiple servers/instances.

**Solutions:**
- **Distributed Session Store:** Use Redis or similar for session state
- **JWT with Limited Payload:** Stateless authentication with minimal session data
- **Database-Backed Carts:** Persist cart state to database instead of session
- **Event Sourcing:** Track cart changes as events for resilience
- **Progressive Merging:** Intelligently merge anonymous and authenticated carts

**Implementation Priority:** HIGH - Core to user experience

## 6. Search Performance at Scale

**Problem:** Full-text search performance degrades with catalog growth.

**Solutions:**
- **Dedicated Search Service:** Implement Elasticsearch or Algolia
- **Search Result Caching:** Cache common search queries
- **Asynchronous Indexing:** Update search indexes via background processes
- **Denormalized Search Documents:** Optimize document structure for search queries
- **Faceted Search Infrastructure:** Build proper foundations for filtered searches

**Implementation Priority:** MEDIUM - Important for catalog discoverability

## 7. Order Processing Pipelines

**Problem:** Complex order fulfillment processes become bottlenecks.

**Solutions:**
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Process order steps via message queues
- **Microservice Decomposition:** Separate services for order processing stages
- **Stateful Workflow Engine:** Implement dedicated workflow/orchestration
- **Idempotent Operations:** Ensure processing steps can safely retry
- **Dead Letter Queues:** Capture and handle failed processing steps

**Implementation Priority:** HIGH - Critical for order fulfillment

## 8. Real-time Inventory & Pricing Updates

**Problem:** Keeping inventory and pricing information current across channels.

**Solutions:**
- **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Stream database changes to consumers
- **WebSockets for Real-time Updates:** Push inventory changes to active sessions
- **Eventual Consistency Model:** Accept some lag for non-critical updates
- **Time-To-Live (TTL) Caching:** Short-lived caches with appropriate invalidation
- **Inventory Buffers:** Maintain safety margins in displayed availability

**Implementation Priority:** MEDIUM - Important for marketplace accuracy
